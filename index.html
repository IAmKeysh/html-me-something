					<h2>Magic Kingdom</h2>
					<p>What can I say other than...magical. We took the ferry, saw Mickey, rode most of the rides we wanted and enjoyed the fireworks and family time. Our matching shirts were a hit and the kids were worn out.</p>

					<h2>Universal Studios</h2>
					<p>We ditched the small children and took Universal by storm, even riding some rides twice. My favorite one was The Simpsons, Fast and the Furious was underwhelming. I got a chance to hear a great cover band do some Shania Twain and Backstreet Boys and my BBQ jackfruit burger and roasted brussel sprouts were surprisingly good.</p>

					<h2>Disney Springs</h2>
					<p>What I remembered as "Downtown Disney" is now completely different (RIP Rainforest Cafe), I was so surprised. There were dozens of stores and restaurants and even rides. We tried out the hot air balloon and the view was spectacular.</p>

					<h2>Fun Spot USA</h2>
					<p>The place that was the closest/cheapest was the place the kids enjoyed the most. It was like a carnival with a full arcade and mini town next door. The kids rode coasters, go karts, bumper cars, and did an obstacle course. The passes were good all day, so we left to eat dinner and went back. Noone in the backseat was awake by the time we got back to the resort, and it was a short ride.</p>

					<h2>Daytona Beach</h2>
					<p>The downside of Orlando is that it is not on a coast. We drove 90 mins each way to enjoy a day at the beach. The weather was great and we were able to rent a table and chairs. My stepbrother Brandon swam too far out past the buoy and my niece had a fit watching the lifeguards extract him. It was quite an experience.</p>

					<h2>Hash House A Go Go</h2>
					<p>We stopped at the place stars like Marlon Wayans and P!nk frequent and had a great breakfast. They had a wall of fame full of photos and autographs. The food was fantastic and the portions were ridiculous. I took home a souvenir coffee mug.</p>
